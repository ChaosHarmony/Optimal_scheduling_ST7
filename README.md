# An Optimal Job Scheduling problem (OJS)
This project focus on the optimization of a task graph with precedence constraints. The goal is to minimize the time spent compute and maybe later to minimize the cost of the job computation.

# Problem formalization
Let's considerer that we have m machines with the same feature, same specific there are identical. We need to run a set of n jobs on the m machines optimal to reduce the makespan (= total time of computation) respecting priority orders on the jobs. Using the convenient notation for optimal scheduling problem we can classifie or problem as $P|prec|C_{max}$.
